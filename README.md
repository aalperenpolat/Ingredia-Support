## ❓ F.A.Q.

### Q: How does Ingredia analyze the ingredients?
A: Ingredia uses a combination of **LLM** for image recognition (scanning ingredient lists or barcodes) and a proprietary AI model to analyze the recognized text against a database of cosmetic components. It then provides simplified explanations and risk classifications.

### Q: Is the ingredient database always up to date?
A: The database is periodically updated with new data. Analysis is based on the best available public and scientific data at the time of the scan.

### Q: Does Ingredia replace professional advice?
A: No. Ingredia is an informational tool for conscious consumer choices. It does not replace the advice of a dermatologist, allergist, or other medical professional.

### Q: Do I need an account to scan products?
A: While scanning functionality is available, a simple log-in via Apple ID or Google is required to securely store your history and preferences, which also enables personalized alternative product suggestions.
